# Tech Club Roadmap 

The main idea of the road map is for the Open Source Community to pitch on ideas
on what HW Tech Club should work. We will run these ideas through our team and the 
approved ones will be added to the list.

## Make a proporsal
Create an feature request Issue 
```

Do be specific on what you need to increase the chance of getting approved 
and you need to have a intial high contribution for us to mantain the 
project in the future.
